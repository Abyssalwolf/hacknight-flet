#  WORD VALIDITY CHECKER
This project aims to develop a software tool that can validate the correctness of words or strings according to a specified set of rules or a dictionary. The checker will help ensure that words are correctly spelled, grammatically correct, properly formatted, and adhere to specific linguistic or domain-specific guidelines.

## How it Works?
To check the validity of a word, enter the word in the text box and click "Check." The system converts all the letters to their lowercase form and then checks if the word exists by comparing it with a list of approximately 70,000 words in the backend. If the word exists, the result will be "Valid word!" If it doesn't exist, the result will be "Invalid word!"
